Project Structure:

Organize your backend code into logical files and directories. Common structures include separating routes, controllers, and data handling.
Setup Express and Middleware:

Initialize Express by requiring the module and creating an instance of the app.
Set up middleware like body-parser to parse incoming data.
Routing:

Create route handlers for different actions your application will handle, such as viewing notes, saving new notes, etc.
Use app.get(), app.post(), and similar methods to define these routes.
Data Storage:

Decide how you'll store notes data (e.g., in-memory array, database).
Create functions to interact with the data storage, like fetching notes, saving new notes, etc.
Route Handling:

Inside your route handlers, call the appropriate data handling functions based on the action requested.
Template Engine:

Configure your Express app to use the chosen template engine to render dynamic views.
Rendering Views:

Inside route handlers, render views with appropriate data to display notes or form fields.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling mechanisms for routes and data operations. Utilize middleware or error handling functions.
Testing:

Test your backend routes using tools like Postman or browser.
Verify that your routes work as expected and handle various scenarios.
Validation and Sanitization (Optional):

Add validation and sanitization checks to ensure incoming data is safe and accurate.
Server Start:

Set up your server to listen on a specific port. Use app.listen() for this.
Integration with Frontend:

Update your frontend to send HTTP requests to the newly created backend routes.
Logging (Optional):

Implement logging to track requests, errors, and other important events.
